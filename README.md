# 📦 Node.js Tut

Welcome to the **Node.js Tut** repository! This project contains a complete backend development tutorial using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. It covers everything from basic server setup to advanced topics like **authentication**, **authorization**, **JWT**, **cookies**, and **MVC architecture** — perfect for building real-world backend applications.

---

## 🚀 Features Covered

- ✅ Core Node.js Modules (`fs`, `http`, `path`, etc.)
- ✅ Express.js with routing and middleware
- ✅ MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- ✅ RESTful API development (CRUD)
- ✅ Authentication using JWT
- ✅ Authorization based on user roles
- ✅ Secure cookies for session handling
- ✅ Environment configuration with `dotenv`
- ✅ MVC architecture structure
- ✅ File uploads with Multer
- ✅ Email sending with Nodemailer
- ✅ Error handling and validations

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ JWT Authentication
- Secure login with token-based authentication
- JWT is issued at login and sent in response
- Protected routes require valid token
- Token verification middleware

### 🔒 Authorization
- Role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. user)
- Middleware to restrict protected routes

### 🍪 Cookies
- JWT can be stored in HTTP-only cookies for added security
- Cookie-parser used to parse cookies on incoming requests
